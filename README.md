## Setup Instructions

### Backend

1. Install Python dependencies:

```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Run the backend server:

### What could have been done with more time?

With more time, the following improvements could be considered:

1. Enhanced error handling and validation on both frontend and backend.
2. Improved styling and user interface design.
3. Implementing unit tests for both frontend and backend components.
4. Adding user authentication for a more secure application.
